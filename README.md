# Super Slime Bros

Super Slime Bros is a remake of the core systems inside the game "super smash bros" written entirely in osl (origin scripting language)

## Overview

SSB is a video game tailored towards more competitive players who want to fight their friends in a complex games environment with many different play styles, there is no specific story that actually affects the gameplay, instead, the most popular version of the game is where you fight against other players using one of many different characters.

In SSB you can select characters and each character has a set of unique moves that it can use in order to deal damage to other players. Damage in this game doesn’t work in the traditional sense, instead of dying when you hit a certain threshold, you get knocked further, the more damage you’ve taken, when you are hit by attacks from players.

## Gameplay

Gameplay is pretty simple, when you get hit by the other player your health value increases and you take more knockback based on how much damage you have taken.

If you fall off the edge of the stage, you lose a life and if you lose all three lives you lose the match.

You can jump up to platforms and if you are pressing the jump key or the down key you don't collide with it. You can press down while on a platform to fall down through a platform.
